**Monte Carlo CUDA**
********************

Monte Carlo used for integration of a 5-D canonical integration via CUDA

This implementation was similar to the dotp implementation whereby threadix is used to do a single calculation on an array. For this I used the method of passing an array of random values for x, y, z, u, v onto the device. Convergence was similar to OMP obviously but incredibly faster. With only one kernel call this was a good strategy for up to 1000000 n values which was enough to converge a good portion of the time.
